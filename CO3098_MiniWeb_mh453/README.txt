Hi

I have implemented the bookmark manager in ASP.NET Core (2.0). I am using Entity Framework as my persistence framework.

I have uploaded the web application to a server you can access it on http://mbexplorer.apphb.com/ I uploaded it to a 
free tier server as of 17/12/2017. If you cant access the url then contact me or try to run it locally following
the getting start instructions below.

Get Started with ASP.NET Core

1. Install .NET Core (https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/)
2. Navigate INSIDE the project in terminal so (CO3098_MiniWeb_mh453/MBExplorer/MBExplorer)
3. Run dotnet run
4. Open browser and copy port ASP.NET Core is listening to i.e http://localhost:5000

Database: Using Microsoft SQL Server

You can recreate the database by running update-database in package manage console.

Please open the project using Visual Studio 2017 not file system.

Thanks
